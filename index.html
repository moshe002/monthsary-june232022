        <p id="long-text">We have been together for 3 years and 4 months now 
        and what a journey it has been. I am grateful to have known you and I am
        really happy that I am with you everyday eventhough we aren't physically 
        close and together. Despite that unlucky circumstance, we still find ways 
        to have fun and bond together. Thank you for putting up with me, I may be 
        crazy, moody and unfair sometimes but thats just me, being a human. Messing up
        and being a jerk sometimes does make me wonder how awful I am, but still,
        I will always not put pride after you. Your feelings and emotions come first, always.
        I love you and I will keep loving you. Thank you for
        everything. Cheers! to more days, weeks, months and years with you, my 
        talented, hard-worker, amazing, superwoman, girlfriend. 
        I love you, keep safe always</p>
        <br><br>
        <p>- Love, <span>Moses</span></p>
